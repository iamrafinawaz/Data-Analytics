        "Wrap the code: Use a try block to wrap the code that might raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "Catch exceptions: Follow the try block with one or more except blocks to catch and handle specific exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Optional else block: Use an else block to execute code if no exception is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cleanup actions: Include a finally block to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred, often for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "Memory management is crucial in Python to ensure the efficient allocation and deallocation of memory. It helps prevent memory leaks and optimizes the performance of applications by automatically handling the lifecycle of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "In Python, try and except blocks are used for exception handling to manage errors gracefully. The try block contains code that might raise an exception, while the except block catches and handles specific exceptions if they occur. This prevents the program from crashing and allows for a controlled response to errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "Python's garbage collection system manages memory using reference counting to track the number of references to objects, deallocating them when the count drops to zero, and cyclic garbage collection to detect and collect cyclic references that reference counting can't handle, ensuring efficient memory usage and preventing leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "In Python's exception handling, the else block is used to execute code that should run only if no exceptions were raised in the try block. It provides a cleaner and more readable way to separate the main logic from error handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "Python's logging module provides several common logging levels, each indicating the severity or importance of the logged message:\n",
        "\n",
        "DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened or might cause problems in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "ERROR: A more serious problem, indicating that the program encountered an issue and couldn't perform some function.\n",
        "\n",
        "CRITICAL: A very serious error, indicating that the program might be unable to continue running.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "The `os.fork()` function in Python creates a new child process by duplicating the current process, suitable for Unix-like systems, while the `multiprocessing` module provides a higher-level interface for creating and managing multiple processes, offering portability across different operating systems and better handling of inter-process communication and task management.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "Closing a file in Python is crucial because it releases the resources associated with the file, ensuring data is properly written to disk and preventing memory leaks. Failure to close a file can lead to resource exhaustion, potential data corruption, and unpredictable program behavior, making it an essential practice for maintaining efficient and reliable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "In Python, `file.read()` reads the entire contents of a file at once and returns it as a single string, while `file.readline()` reads one line at a time from the file and returns it as a string, including the newline character. Use `file.read()` when we need to process the whole file content at once and `file.readline()` for line-by-line processing, which is more memory efficient for large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "The `logging` module in Python is used for tracking events that happen when software runs. It provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. we can capture different levels of information (like `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`), and output these logs to various destinations, such as the console, files, or remote servers, making it easier to diagnose problems, monitor application performance, and keep an audit trail.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "The os module in Python is used for interacting with the operating system. In file handling, it provides functions to manipulate files and directories, such as creating, removing, and renaming files or directories, as well as checking their properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "Challenges in Python's memory management include handling cyclic references that cause memory leaks, fragmentation from allocating memory over time, and performance overhead from reference counting and garbage collection. Efficient coding practices are essential to optimize memory usage and application performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "In Python, we can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword followed by the exception type we want to raise. We can also provide an optional message for more context.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "Multithreading improves performance and responsiveness by allowing concurrent execution of tasks. It efficiently handles I/O-bound tasks, utilizes multiple CPU cores, and divides complex workflows into smaller threads, enhancing real-time systems, servers, and parallel processing applications.\n",
